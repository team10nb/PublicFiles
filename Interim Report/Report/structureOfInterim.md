1. Introduction

   Introduction to structure and content, introduce sorting algorithms

   1.1 Motivation and Description of the Problem

   1.2 Aims and Objectives

   The aim of this project is to build a game-like learning tool with the animation feature to achieve visualising sorting algorithms. The main picture is that the software will give a taste at the beginning by providing some easy tutorials. After that, it will provide several modules for users to learn different algorithm principles and their correctness in a simplified way. During the process, explanations and guides will be displayed with an animation. Finally, exercises will be provided for them to check whether they understand well enough.

   1.3 Description of the Work to Solve the Problem

2. Background Information and Research

   2.1 Background

   2.2 Survey of Existing Systems

   The problem to be solved, which is demonstrated in the introduction, has several solutions to it already exist. However, different solutions are oriented to different groups of stakeholders. Research on existing systems mostly help to extract commonly achieved features and find aspects which can be improved. Key decisions of implementation can also be referenced from existing systems. Five existing systems on different platforms are introduced in this chapter.

   2.3 Market Research

   The software being built will finally be deployed into the market, and much of business or technical requirements resides in the minds of stakeholders. Therefore, market research is conducted to gather requirements and suggestions from stakeholders. Team 10 used three professional approaches to conduct market research. Focus group to hear from stakeholders inner voice in a group meeting, survey to gather data from a big group of people and interview to listen to an individual's opinion. The results are demonstrated in this section.

5. Implementation

   5.1 Key Implementation Decisions

   After technical research, Team 10 has gained some knowledge about the fundamental of building software with animation. Therefore, initial decisions about how to implement such software are divided into five parts. The platform is initially decided to be the Windows system. Web will be the programming base, and IntelliJ Idea will be used as the IDE. Git with GitHub is the version control tool and team management tool as well. Detailed explanations and analysis are as follows.
