## Minute

1. Review the results of problems raised by supervisor in last formal meeting
2. Report the work of last week
   - illegal and legal input page
     - shuffle: tell user what is the legal input. (provide persudo code, compare input type, set proper context), before shuffle tell user we have popped all the range of legal input
     - define the legal input, maybe provide pseudocode
     - explanation: put it in the next page
     - animation: allow user to play specific input set.
     - set illegal and legal inputs seperately? or provide one example first, then mix illegal and legal together randomly.
     - restrict the input size
   - partial and total correctness page
     - particuler number? or set random number. should cover all random number
     - Or let user enter the input
     - Emphasize input and output rather than testing
     - The first two algorithms are fine
3. Plan for the next week
4. confirm the requirements
   - decide which part is vital and which part can be throw
   - prepare to handle tasks within limited time, rick management

## Comments

The meeting went well and all the tasks were finished. However, the design of correctness tutorial cannot satisfy the supervisor and needs to be revised.
