### Outcomes

(summary of all discussed main points, all decisions, all action points)

1. Lask week's task

	- Mail to Heshan sent
	- Heshan's documents pushed to GitHub
	
2. Requirements Analysis

   - Share

     1. Tang: Encourage

     2. Jiang: Game. First open simple algorithms to him, such as bubble first, and then open others to him. But in this case, suppose what he wants to learn is difficult ones, we cannot achieve this. May integral. Bubble, integral, unlock (recharge); token, upgrade, reward mechanism; within a single algorithm or all algorithms? Milepost.

     3. Huang：In the two modes, the algorithm distinguishes the difficulty, what can be exchanged for reward token, skin and interface color?

     4. Han：There may not be long-term users who will be lost after learning; therefore, I don't want to have login. Target users: self-taught programmers, people who don't understand

     5. yn：May add efficiency part, but we pay more attention to correction. Let him finish the evaluation on his own or when he finishes it?

       6. Chen：

          - Prefabricated animation

          - Novice tutorial
          - Test the demo module, let the user input the number by himself, the previous step, the next step, and the automatic playback, so that the user can know what the algorithm is doing
          - User drag module, (we'll discuss a few more at that time) because he probably understands that he imitates the way the algorithm drags, which is more interactive and user friendly. It can detect whether he is dragging the right one in real time, which is more interactive than the one dragging on the right, and can also prompt
          - Unlock the final module: scratch pseudo code, there may be several steps wrong, let him correct
          - If the user wants to see the code, show him the code in various languages we provide

       7. When showing the code to him, show the language he wants? Heshan is not Party A. We may evaluate what percentage of users want to see the code and give Heshan the things they have investigated for confirmation.

     8. Help other users understand and master the significance of sorting algorithm?

     9. Once again, we can't understand what correction is and how to prove it.


   - determine the target audience and market analysis of our products (where can they be used? Will you use them more? Competition comparison, analysis, advantages and limitations, which Heshan requires to be written in the report)
     -Don't think about kids, because it's hard to deal with.
     -College students who are interested in computers but basic.
     -Host group: Freshman CS major, teachers
     market analysis
     -Do you want to send out questionnaires or ethic?
     Competitive products

   - literature review

     1. Animation demonstration https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html, no code, only animation sort
     2. Code puzzle http://snapapps.github.io/edgy/app/edgy.html It looks like pseudo code, but it's not for sorting algorithms
     3. Galant diagram demonstration https://github.com/mfms-ncsu/galant Although the form of bar may be monotonous, they use Galant graph, which may replace this thing
     4. Sortko: using mobile devices to learn sorting algorithm https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6185079 This paper is a mobile phone software, this article reference value is relatively high, has the collection data.
     5. Visa: visualization of sorting algorithms https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6240816 Visualization of sorting algorithm,
     6. All of these can be used in the literature review. The professor's words can be shown to him.
     7. Algorithm animation diagram
        -Discuss what we need to do in the requirement analysis phase (survey and interview to collect information, determine functional and non functional, draw UML, etc.)
        -I didn't have time to talk about it this time
     8. Select SE method, discuss the arrangement of the later stage, and preliminarily determine the process (estimated to be 15 minutes)
        -Which SE method is more suitable for us? (maybe try the combination for a while, as Dave said)
        -Agile, while doing the process, there may be confirmation work and a process involving stackholders.
        -The general direction should be clear.
        -Test documentation? After confirming the complete function, we should be very clear about how to test the process and effect.
        -After the selection, discuss our future plans and roughly determine what to do in the future
        -Finish the requirement by the 29th
     9. Ethics form (estimated 10 minutes)
        -Han and Colin are responsible for the assignment.
     10. Website (estimated 15 minutes)
         -I bought a template and picked a template to show you. only one index.html For convenience.
         -Project brief (such as timeline), project document (download link, data, code version), what are you doing at this stage (cycle, file, introduction, continuous update), team member introduction (email, division of labor), and other modules to see what other requirements are
         -How to add document to the website. The result of the current discussion is to put links. Tym will do it.
         -Add project introduction, copy to be sent.
         -The logo doesn't have to be. It's OK to design one at will, and it's OK to find it online.

   - Discuss the definition of correction (estimated 15 minutes)

     ​	On correction, we put forward our own views

     ​	Meet the definition? You can prove it in your own way.

     ​	Tell the user that the algorithm is correct.

     ​	How to realize this requirement and possible ways

9. Next meeting preparation
  - **Chairperson:** Chen
  - **Secretary:** Tang Huang
  - (next meeting after next) Huang + Jiang
  - **Time:** Thursday

## Comments

> From sec: actually, I feel that the summary of the last meeting is not complete enough.)

The meeting proceeded smoothly, and most of the discussions needed to be done were completed within the scheduled time and a result was reached.
There are a few things that are not very good:

1. I don't understand some processes very well, and the preparation work is not enough, so that I don't know how to guide the discussion in the right direction. For example, today's discussion on the follow-up plan did not get a clear result because I was not familiar with the whole process and did not express the content to be discussed well. You need to do more preparation next time.
2. The topic change is very stiff, just reading agenda. I'll learn about it the next time the other team members do the chair person. Maybe when we talk about each discussion point, we can give some ideas and talk about something to help people think of more things.
