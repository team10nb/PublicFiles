## Agenda

*The whole meeting is expected to take 30 minutes.*

1. Opening（1m）

   This week went well. We have successfully completed the first draft of the literature review, and interim report and use case are being written.

2. 进度汇报（20m）

   1. Literature Review

      Everything is finished except the technical research. The directions of technical research still need to be discussed in next meeting. And we need to decide which programming language we will use as soon as possible.

      Please check the first draft and expanded description. Do you have any questions?

   2. Requirements

      Confirmation of functional requirements

   3. Questionnaire report（2m）

      We will update the progress of questionnaire collection last reported to you. 

      We interviewed Aidin, teacher of Introduction to Algorithms of year 1.

      He helped us distribute the questionnaire in the lecture and got about 100 results from freshmen in science. 

      For more detailed data, please see our questionnaire report. 

      In brief, there is almost no change from the previous results, and the user preferences are basically the same. 

      Since he also want to know his students better, we will share the survey results with him. 

      He gave us some practical advice, which we'll cover in the next section.

   4. Interview report (5m)

      Our interview report to Aidin has been attached to the mail. We ran the interview last Thursday, with Colin the main interviewer, me the second interviewer and Yijie the secretary. Next, I will introduce Colin, the main interviewer, to give you a brief introduction.

      (Colin)

      Thanks. He mentioned that, if we do a good job, he will use our software next year in IA. Sounds good!

      Since he also want to know his students better, we will share the survey results with him. 

   5. Prototype (10m)

      We noticed that in the last meeting, we weren't able to describe our prototype clearly, and you may not have fully understood the intent of our prototype. So this time, we decided to put the prototype at the end of this meeting, to give you a more detailed introduction.
