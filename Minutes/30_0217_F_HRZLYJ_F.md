## Comments
- Chairperson did not do enough work before the meeting, so mant time was spent on thinking, which can be avoided if the chairperson can provide some possible solutions. 
- Be decisive. In today's meeting, many problems needed to be decided. But members do not have obvious tendency, many time was wasted waiting for an answer. Chairperson may need to decide in this situation.
