### Outcomes

No formal meeting until the beginning of the spring semester.

We shall start the coding from the simplest sorting algorithm.

Strategy on how to begin the coding:

Work together first wo build a structure and implement a simple sorting algorithm as a model or template.

After every one got the idea of how to code, programming pairs will be divided.

The arrangement during the holiday will depend on us

Send progress during the holiday if necessary.

Best wishes to the remaining exams.
