*The whole meeting is expected to take 30 minutes.*
1.Acceptance Testing
- package test
- show heshan the software
2.Check final report
- Passive word (whether to use), can “we, I...” be used?
- Code hierarchy
- Design, Implementation part

## Minute



1. User interface design 
   - should not include the screenshot of final product.
   - Too long
   - Maybe we can put the progress of design to appendix

2. Design

   - Give an overview of the all design, framework, structure.
   - Just talk about **main design**! No need to describe all of them. Put them into catalogue.
   - Compare our design to other similar softwares.
   - Describe why design in this way.
   - Provide ideas instead of descriptions because concepts behind may be more important.
   - We can link material to the design (refer to Fig.1 / "the function is showed in chapter xx").
   - Rather than description everything, it is better to do more justification.

3. Report structure

   - Divide user interface design into three parts，procedure，tutorial，and correctness.  Adjust the order, highlight the innovation. For new functions, stress it is NEW! 

   - Decribtion advantages of the design.

   - Put hierachy before the implementation.

   - Hierachy and overview are needed for design and implementation chapter.

   - Add design of the system, the structure of the system

     

### acceptance testing

1. Add pesoducode comments
2. Order of result, increasing or decreasing
3. Selection sort assertion
4. Connection of assertion and code
5. Aim and purpose of this sorting algorithms, in first in, add brief introduction
