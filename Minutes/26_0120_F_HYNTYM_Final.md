## Minute

Last week we finished rest part of the Tic-Tac-Toe, had basic understanding of React, learned how to test and discussed design and structure.

Discussed some skills and functions of React.

Decided to distrubute works instead of dividing into three groups, each group does the same job.

### Components Discussion Result

1.  InputBar (an input bar): regular expression is required to check input format; require the user to input **legal input (integer)**
2.  Bar: according to the value, change the height of itself
3.  ProgressLine: show user's progress
4.  ~~Button~~
5.  Module (imageContainer, ProgressLine are contained)
6.  Player (control module, which contains progress bar and play stop, previous next buttons): **Detailed trace's data structure should be clarified**
