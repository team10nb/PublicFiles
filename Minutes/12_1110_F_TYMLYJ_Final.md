## Agenda

*The whole meeting is expected to take 60 minutes.*

1. Review of last week

2. Questionnaire

   1. See the results
   2.  What is the results
   3.  Depending on these results, what should be changed in the current requirements
   4.  When to end
   
3. Are we following the full year timetable plan?

   1. It seems that nobody is taking control of the whole process.
   
4. internal report

   1. divide the work

5. Prototype

   1. According to the existing resources, it may have to be redone. At that time, I did it according to the idea of the game. But now, if we want to abandon it, first, is Heshan willing to (because she said at that time that she saw our idea was very interesting, and she wanted to make a game for us), and the second reason was not enough. I think if we decide to give up, it is better to give her some reasons in detail. This part can also be written in the internal report.
   2. Question: can it correspond to the requirement we wrote?
   2. Collect your general and abstract ideas about prototypes, and I will make them into pictures.
   3. Although we don't know what platform, we can do the desktop version first. Then design something else.
   4. Linkage of the following [demonstration mode]

6. interview

   1. I heard that AJ is not easy to get in touch with on focus group, so how do we design it? Or when? I think it will be the end of the term if you don't make an appointment with him, or you can interview other teachers
   1. When to send email, rehearsal and interview;
      - Find another teacher!

      - If teachers want to use it, do you need to distinguish [demonstration mode (used by teachers)] and [learning mode (used by students)]

7. UML

## Comments

Now I feel that the moderator should do such work: summarize the work, throw out the topic, cause discussion, draw results, and promote the topic.

Because the first two projects need Yani, and she didn't come at first, so I did the later project first.

We identified the target population: the beginner of sorting algorithm.

After the meeting, we determined the requirements of the final version of the large document and the content to be reported next time.

Write something else I want to say: I found that when I made a prototype, even if I made a diagram, people didn't necessarily understand what I meant. So we have to explain them. Of course, pictures are better than no pictures.
