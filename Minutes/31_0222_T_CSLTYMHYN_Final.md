*The whole meeting is expected to take 30 minutes.*

1. Opening（2m）

   - Chairperson and secretary
   - The meeting is expected to take 30 minutes
   - We will
     - review the previous stages
     - introduce the software
     - talk about interim report feedback
  
2. Revision of previous stages
   - Agile methodology has been taken to develop software
   - A sprint lasts for a week with one day off
   - One informal meeting has been held each week, mainly for task distribution for the whole week and discussion of big dicisions
   - We've got a stand-up meeting every day at night, talking about what we've done that day, any questions we have and plan for the next day
   - Each task will be distributed to at least two people, we call this pair programming to ensure the quality of the code and help members aquire knowledge from peers
   - Previous sprints: 
     - Aquire knowledge of the language and library
     - construct the structure of the software and confirm the design detail
     - build basic components
     - build UI and write code for animate sorting algorithms
     - design correctness details and try to improve procedure part of the software
     - prepare for the final report and refactor
  
3. Introduction to the software
   - Yuting demonstrate the software
   - Yani demonstrate the proto of correctness
   - validate requirements
  
4. Interim report feedback and discussion
   - Ruizi and Yijie talk about interim report feedback

5. After meeting

   - Next meeting?
   - Book a classroom

## Minute

1. Introduced our processes and techniques during the holiday.
2. Yuting introduced the current demo to Heshan, and she thinks 
   1. // complexity, worst case, average and best case.
   2. space complexity why big oh of 1.
   删掉
   3. looks very nice.
   谢谢
   4. negative number, valid range should be told.
   在上方加一下
   5. setting: preferred language
   改成language，BGM，
   6. interface
   
3. Yani introduced prototype of correctness
   1. not terminated algorithm 这句话也需要改一下
   2. later use this software to teach ACE.
4. Requirements
   1. sorting algorithms finished
   2. talk about (performance/legal input?) in ??????, not here(???), provide guidance and legal input to user
5. 1. if generate the input automatically, size of input? efficiency, large input what should happen. 用户输的数字太多了怎么办（缩小？）
   1. efficiency, maybe record the real time.
   2. space complexity, depending on data structure. time complexity based on how to implement that. 
   删掉不管
   3. create array based on the array size. (?)
6. interim report feedback
   1. 问：feedback general. is there anything wrong? good job. we want to get detailed fb. 答：i dont know why 70+. very small number of students 80+. Quite difficult to give mark above 80. 70+ Highest mark to give. See **original work**. 
   2. 他其实是觉得给多了。这是他给过的给interim report最高的分了？要得高分，你需要证明有 original contribution、teaching delivery、existing works，justification。
   3. 分数
      1. 75+：not all the parts to 80+.
      2. 80+：published in a conference at least. Teaching and learning conference. 
      3. 90+：same level as jianfeng.
   4. grammar: 我给70分的意思就是你很高了。
   5. citation: email
   6. screenshot: source of this software should be cited.

## Comments 

The progress is somehow good with most of the procedure part done.

Correctness and final report preparation will be the main tasks in the next stage.
