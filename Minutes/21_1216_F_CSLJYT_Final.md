## Agenda

*The whole meeting is expected to take 30 minutes.*

1. Review(Every one is hard)
   - Yuting and Yijie are main editors, and every member is responsible for their own part.
   - Ruizi always takes the initiative to write reports.
   - Yanni is particularly helpful in market research.
   - Yiming make the implementation so beautiful
2. Problem of last stage
   - The next time when completing the assigned tasks, especially those related to other people, such as the part you write that needs to be edited, modified and approved by others, please do not regard the final DDL as your own DDL, because the students behind will be very hard.
   - If you delay tasks, it will lead to a decline in quality. If you feel that your task is too heavy, you must also give feedback to the person responsible for the task allocation or tell the team leader. You must not force yourself to lead to poor completion

3. Optimization of task allocation process
   - When a task is thrown out, it takes five seconds to claim it. If no one wants to do it on its own, it will be allocated after the meeting
   - The distribution should take into account the member's characteristics as far as possible, and try to balance the tasks
4. Process optimization in the meeting

- The agenda should be given to the Secretary and uploaded to the group at least an hour in advance

- The agenda should be as compact and efficient as possible

- Try not to do anything unrelated to the meeting and respect other students

5. Assign meeting tasks and DDL

- Don't make DDL too long for short tasks, which may lead to procrastination

- When making tasks, be precise and detailed. For example, don't let everyone do technical research, but what is the specific aspect

6. Keep task completion and quality is high

7. Check grammar errors in advance

8. Explain of problems timely
