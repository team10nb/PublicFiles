## Comments
The process of this meeting has not been smooth. The main issues are reporting and discussion and redistribution of items reported.
However, the progress was not smooth and the assigned tasks were not well completed.
Chen Shiquan and Huang Yani's use case stalled because they did not ask BGL
Tang Yiming's requirement document has not been modified
Lu Yijie's literature review task is wrong
Everyone's technical research is progressing poorly
The following reasons:
Did not say the expected time before the meeting
DMS course burden is too heavy
Classroom air conditioning temperature is too high
Meeting seminars are more appropriate
Progress may need to be followed up before the meeting
The presiding officer may supervise the task for a certain period of time after the meeting.
