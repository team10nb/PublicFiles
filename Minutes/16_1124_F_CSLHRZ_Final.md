## Comments
This meeting has not been held smoothly. 

The main task for this meeting are reporting and discussion and redistribution of items reported.
However, the progress was not smooth and the assigned tasks were not well completed.

- Shiliang Chen and Yani Huang's use case diagram has stalled because they haven't ask Bryan.
- Yiming Tanf's requirement document has not been modified.
- Lu Yijie's literature review task is wrong
- Everyone's technical research is progressing poorly

**This may due to the following reasons:**

- The expected time has not claimed before the meeting
- DMS course burden is too heavy
- Classroom's temperature is too high
- Meeting which focus on discussion are more appropriate
- Progress may need to be followed up before the meeting
- Chairperson may supervise the task for a certain period of time after the meeting.
