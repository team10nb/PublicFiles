## Agenda

*The whole meeting is expected to take 60 minutes.*

1. Review the work 
   - Animation algorithms
      Yani - insertion sort has some technical issues (inserting animation is not natural)
      merge sort is not figured out
   - UI (collect ideas and suggestions)
      Yijie - help popups
      Yijie - language icon
      Yuting - adjust margins in the main page
   - Test and final report plan
      yani - fix test issues
      Yuting - router test issues
      Ruizi - description is almost done except test
      All - finish test plan  for each components
      All - complete test log
      Yijie shared final report information
      - design, test, code hierachy(explain how to implement, tdd with test log, how to design and modify project structure)
      - test in  appendix
      - jsx with openning (author, features, third-party library, included components)
      - Yuting - try react-styleguidist
      - Yijie - timeline shall include conclusion to the last week and encountered problems and solution with reflection(Yijie finds the style of this part)
      - All - find problem and solution with reflection and note in timeline
   - Electron 
2. Integrate current progress
3. Correctness and procedure-implementation design 
   - Refer to the requirement doc.
   - Yani & Shiliang - make prototype
4. Discuss the next stage's task (About 20 minutes)
